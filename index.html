            <h1>Happy Anniversary to the love of my life ‚ô•Ô∏è</h1>
            <p>
                Thank you for making every single day a joy. I‚Äôm so grateful to have found my dream companion in our Lord. Even with all the signs we‚Äôve received from God, I never needed a sign to know you were the one from our very first dates I already knew I wanted you. Still, it amazes me that God gave us His blessing for one another. I believe He had us written together long before we even met, preparing each of us until the time was right.<br><br>

                God has truly allowed me to see the difference between who I was before and who I am now. I know I wasn‚Äôt worthy of you then and I own up that, but now I see He was shaping me to hopefully be worthy of such a rare, amazing woman. That thought alone makes me emotional. That‚Äôs why I always tell you I promise to give you my very best, even in the difficult times. You are the dream that came true, and for so long I could hardly believe you even said yes to me.<br><br>

                Everything you do for me and my family means the world to me. You‚Äôve given me things no one else ever has, and I can never thank you enough. You are so beautiful, Gaby, truly the most beautiful woman I‚Äôve ever met. I only have eyes for you, and I always look at you in awe. I will always keep praying for you.<br><br>

                I love you ‚ù§Ô∏è<br><br>

                (One of the best parts is that my ‚Äúowner‚Äù is so fine ü§©üòçüòò)
